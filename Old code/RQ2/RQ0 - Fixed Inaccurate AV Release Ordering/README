This Quality model calculates various fields about the quality of each apache project with al least 100 closed bugs. No input is required for this program. It collects all apache jira project keys, then iterates over the list calculating information regarding the bugs and corresponding affect version recorded for each project. The output is in the QualityModel.csv. It is not ordered, therefore I ordered the csv after its creation by the percent w/ AV column. This file is renamed OrderedQualityModel.csv. Below is a description of each column in the output csv. The program takes about 10 minutes to run, it prints out the name of the project its on, just so I know its still running. There are 622 total projects. Of the 622 projects, 230 have at least 100 closed bugs.

The weird names list was generated manually. I first calculated all names of releases in all projects that were recorded as an affect version, but do not have a release date. I manually looked at these names and created a list of common names in various projects that are not actual names of versions, but terms for something else. Below is the list.

Columns in the CSV:
Key - Project key

Closed Bugs - the number of closed bugs for the project

Closed Bugs w/o Affect Version - the number of closed bugs in the project where the affect version is empty

Percent w/o AV - the percent of closed bugs with out affect version (Closed Bugs w/o Affect Version / Closed Bugs)

Num Bugs w/ AV after Fix - The number of closed bugs with affect versions that have an affect version after the resolution/fix date release

Percent Bugs w/ AV after Fix (out of Bugs w/ AV) - The percent of closed bugs with affect versions that have an affect version after the resolution/fix date release (Num Bugs w/ AV after Fix / Closed Bugs w/ Affect Version)

Num Bugs w/ AV w/o Release Dates - The number of closed bugs with affect versions that do not have a release date. This does not include those affect versions that have a name in the weird name list.

Percent Bugs w/ AV w/o Release Date (out of Bugs w/ AV)  - The percent of closed bugs with affect versions that do not have a release date. Not including those with AV's names in the weird name list. (Num Bugs w/ AV w/o Release Dates / Closed Bugs w/ Affect Version)

Num Bugs w/ AV w/ Weird Names - The number of bugs with affect version who's names are in the weird name list. These are assumed to be not actual names of releases

Percent Bugs w/ AV w/ Weird Names (out of Bugs w/ AV) - The percent of bugs with affect version who's names are in the weird name list. ( Num Bugs w/ AV w/ Weird Names / Closed Bugs w/ Affect Version)

Num Bugs Missing Creation/Resolution Date - The number of closed bugs with affect versions whose resolution or creation date did not exist or was NULL.

Percent Bugs Missing Creation/Resolution Date (out of Bugs w/ AV) - The percent of bugs with affect versions whose resolution or creation date did not exist or was NULL. ( Num Bugs Missing Creation/Resolution Date / Closed Bugs w/ Affect Version)

Total Bugs w/ AV and a Problem  - The total number of bugs with affect versions that have a problem. This does not equal a sum of the number of previous calculated problems because a bug may have multiple affect versions each with a problem. So in order to not double count a bug of this case, I calculated this field by adding to the total each time a bug had a missing creation date or a missing resoltuion date or an affect version with a missing date or an affect version with a weird name or an affect version after a fix date.

Percent Closed Bugs w/ AV and a Problem (out of Bugs w/ AV)  - The percent of bugs with affect versions that have a problem. ( Total Bugs w/ AV and a Problem / Closed Bugs w/ Affect Version)

Percent Closed Bugs w/ Problem Including Missing AV (out of Closed Bugs) - The percent of closed bugs that have a problem including the problem of missing an affect version. (((Closed bugs - Closed Bugs w/ Affect Verion) + Total Bugs w/ AV and a Problem) / Closed Bugs)
