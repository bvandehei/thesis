This code works to parse the Jira and Bugzilla JSON tickets.
These are two seperate pograms.
The file names need to be editted before running.
They successfully parse the fields in the first line of the output file.
However, formatting is not perfect yet, long descriptions and long comments
cause the csv files to look very strange and impossible to read.
Bugzilla limits the amount of requests per hour also, so it cannot parse
a whole input file at a time.
To run these files, edit the file names for the input .csv and output file name.
Also, add the jar to your classpath.
