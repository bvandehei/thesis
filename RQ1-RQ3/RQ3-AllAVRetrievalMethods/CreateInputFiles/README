This program is a helper programs that generates a table with the following items
for each project: BUG ID (of closed bugs with a git commit associated with it and !(AV == CV == FV)), BUG order (the ticket resolution date), classes touched by the fix (separated by a "|"), Last AV (the oldest AV as reported in JIRA), TV (Version index where the bug ticket is created), FV (Version where the ticket is fixed according to git commit). This program accepts an input file called Projects.csv for a list of projects to create the tables for and their corresponding github repo urls. This project out puts a two csv. The first is a table with the previously mentioned items. I manually ordered each of these tables by BUG order after the csv were generated. The second csv is a list of versions for each Project with their corresponding index, release date, ID, name, and description. This is useful when I need information of the names and order of versions for the RQ2 heuristic, heuristic++, and LAV methods.
